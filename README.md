**Citography ADD-ON**

Citography is a Blender add-on developed for spatial exploration, enabling users to traverse collected data and experiment with different visual representations. Its main goal is to confront and rethink the established methods of depicting our surroundings. Through this, it invites users to reimagine the instruments and perspectives traditionally employed for spatial exploration.

This mapping strategy is an integral part of the 'Citography' research â€” an endeavor of mine where I investigate the intersection of digital technology, space, and the citizens' experiences.

**Prerequisites:**

- For optimal functionality, ensure that PyProj, Pandas, and Pillow are installed in your Blender Python environment.

**Recommendation:**

- To use the add-on's full potential, we recommend the wonderful [BlenderGIS](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/tree/master) add-on, developed by domlysz. It streamlines the process of importing maps and georeferencing scenes.
