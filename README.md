**Citography ADD-ON**

Citography is a Blender add-on developed for spatial exploration, enabling users to explore collected data and experiment with its representation. Its goal is to confront and rethink the established methods of depicting our surroundings. Through this, it invites users to criticaly reimagine the tools and perspectives employed for spatial exploration [Instagram - see more](https://www.instagram.com/wero.gajda/). 

This mapping tool is an integral part of the 'Citography' research of [mine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weronika-gajda-8b20ab109/) where I investigate the intersection of digital technology, space, and the citizens' experiences.

**Prerequisites:**

- For optimal functionality, ensure that PyProj, Pandas, and Pillow are installed in your Blender Python environment.

**Recommendation:**

- To use the add-on's full potential, I recommend the wonderful [BlenderGIS](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/tree/master) add-on, developed by domlysz. It enables the process of importing maps and georeferencing scenes.
